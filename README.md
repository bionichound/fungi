# Fungi

Fungi is a Golang library that can be used to add a functional flavour to your projects.

Fungi uses **generics** meaning that it requires a minimum go version of 1.18.

Please note that because of Fungi's use of generics some fungi functions can be slow
compared to their typed versions.

# Installation

Using go modules, just run the get command:

```bash
go get -u github.com/bionichound/fungi
```
